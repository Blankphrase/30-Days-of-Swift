30 Days of Swift
=========

![30 Days of Swift](https://cfe-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/30-days-swift/images/30DaysOfSwift.png)

For the next 30 days, we'll teach you the basics of Swift and teach you how to build a simple iOS application with Swift. Each day provides a different topic and allows you to reference that topic at anytime. 

This repo has been created to enable you to view the related source code for the 30 Days of Swift Course. 

## How-To
1. Each file (or set of files) relates to it's respecitve lecture:
	Day 10: Swift Statements
	File(s): [Day 10 - Switch Statements.playground](../Day 10 - Switch Statements.playground)
	Lecture Link: [Day 10: Swift Statements](https://codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/30-days-swift/day-10-switch-statements/)

2. If/when you get stuck within the lecture, reference these files to check against your code to ensure accuracy. These files will be the most update files and even more so than the video lecture.

3. When in doubt, pull/download, our code directly to your computer and then try that version. If there's an error with our code, please submit an issue.

Thank you!
